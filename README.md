QuizApp
===================================
This is a simple game application mostly developed following the book of "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide"
The player will be asked muliple questions that he has to answer by true or false, then at the end he will get his final score
and the time he spent solving all the questions. Finally, he would be able to navigate again between the questions in order to review.
Again, this is a simple app and all the data is hardcoded inside it, so it is not scalable to a high limit.
